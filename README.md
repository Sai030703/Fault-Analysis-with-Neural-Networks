# Fault-Analysis-with-Neural-Networks

OVERVIEW 

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates the use of neural networks for fault classification in Tennessee Eastman Process Simulation Dataset. The notebook includes steps for exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model training, along with evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.
