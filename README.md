# Fault-Analysis-with-Neural-Networks

OVERVIEW 

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates the use of neural networks for fault classification in a process monitoring dataset. The notebook includes steps for exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model training, along with evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.
